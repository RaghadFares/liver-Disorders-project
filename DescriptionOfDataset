General information about the dataset


-The source of the dataSet: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatemehmehrparvar/liver-disorders


-The goal of collecting this dataset
The aim of creating this dataset is to study the differences between US patients and Indian patients with liver disease.
Therefore, there are differences based on gender in predicting liver disease,
as previous studies found the number of people infected with this disease,
its prevalence rate, and many statistical details.

## Show the missing value:
We have 4 missing values in a column "A/G Ratio"

'''{python}
missing_values = df.isna()

missing_counts = missing_values.sum();

print("Missing values in each column:");
print(missing_counts);

print(rows_with_missing);
'''
______
## Show the Min., 1st Qu., Median, Mean ,3rd Qu.,Max. for each numeric column:
using summary_stats() function

'''{python}
summary_stats=df.describe();
print(summary_stats);
'''
From these summary statistics, several key observations can be made:

#Age:
- There is significant variability in ages, ranging from 4 to 90 years, with an average of 44.74 years. This indicates that liver disease can affect individuals across a wide age range.
#Total Bilirubin (TB):
- The values vary significantly, with a maximum of 75 and a minimum of 0.4. The mean is 3.3, while the median is 1. This suggests the presence of extreme values or some deviation in TB levels.
#Direct Bilirubin (DB):
- DB values range from 0.1 to 19.7, with a mean of 1.49, indicating significant variation in direct bilirubin levels.
#Alkaline Phosphatase (Alkphos):
- Alkphos values range from 63 to 2110, with a mean of 290.58, indicating the presence of extreme values and significant variation in alkaline phosphatase levels.
#Serum Glutamic-Pyruvic Transaminase (Sgpt):
- Sgpt values range from 10 to 2000, with a mean of 80.71, indicating significant variation in Sgpt levels.
#Serum Glutamic-Oxaloacetic Transaminase (Sgot):
- Sgot values range from 10 to 4929, with a mean of 109.91, indicating significant variation in Sgot levels.
#Total Protein (TP):
- TP values range from 2.7 to 9.6, with a mean of 6.48, suggesting convergence of data and no significant variation in total protein levels.
#Albumin (ALB):
- ALB values range from 0.3 to 2.8, with a mean of 0.947, indicating convergence of data and no significant variation in albumin levels.
#Albumin/Globulin Ratio (A/G Ratio):
- The A/G Ratio ranges from 1 to 2, with a mean of 1.29, indicating convergence of data and no significant variation in the albumin/globulin ratio.
#Selector:
- The values are binary, limited to 1 and 2, indicating binary classification labels.
______
##Show the Variance

'''{python}
variance= df.var(numeric_only=True);
print(variance);
'''

Variance helps understand the extent of dispersion or scatter of values in each column. As the variance increases,
it indicates that the values are more spread out and scattered away from the mean, whereas decreasing variance suggests that the values are less scattered and closer to the mean value.
Therefore, our variance results indicate:
#Age:
The variance is high, so the level of dispersion and spread of values is high.

#TB, DB, Alkphos, Sgpt, Sgot:
The variance is very high in these columns, so the level of dispersion and spread of values is very high.

#TP, ALB, A/G Ratio, Selector:
The variance is moderate to low in these columns, so the level of dispersion and spread of values is moderate to low.
